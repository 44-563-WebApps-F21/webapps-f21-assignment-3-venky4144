                  <h4>algorithm of linear algebra</h4>
                  <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function#History,_terminology,_and_notation">Leonhard Euler introduced the function in 1763.[7][8][9] However, 
                    he did not at that time choose any specific symbol to denote it.
                     In a 1784 publication, Euler studied the function further, choosing the Greek letter π to denote it: he wrote πD for "the multitude of numbers less than D, 
                     and which have no common divisor with it".
                      This definition varies from the current definition for the totient function at D = 1 
                      but is otherwise the same. The now-standard notation[8][11] φ(A) comes from Gauss's 1801 treatise Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,
                      [12][13] although Gauss didn't use parentheses around the argument and wrote φA. 
                    Thus, it is often called Euler's phi function or simply the phi function.. </blockquote>
